Hello dear network, I hope you are doing well!!
The time is serious, it is also for questions, for research. I continued with my multiplayer game project using
socket.io it has not been easy and I have made little progress compared to last week. I have made a major change.
Here is what I had planned:
**** the user fills in his username (1)
**** he lands on a page with all other connected players (2)
**** he chooses one of them to face each other (3)
**** both land on the page where the game interface is (4)

But I realized that the path was going to be very complicated, especially from step 3 to step 4.
So here's what I plan to do now
**** the user fills in his username and a special game code (1)
**** he lands on the game page and confronts the user who would have entered the same special game code as him (2)

So here is the new deal .I really hope to get through this project.See you next time
